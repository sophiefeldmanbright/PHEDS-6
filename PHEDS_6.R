# Run the script below first, so that you can see all of the variables that are created.  Then follow steps 1-3 to make changes to the script.
 
# 1. Add your full name as a new variable to the list below
Sophie <- "Sophie Feldman Bright"
Ed <- "Ed Feldman Bright"
James<- "James Oguta"

# 2. Rewrite the variables below with your own favourite things (to show what happens when you change something in the script)
Favourite_colour <- "purple"
Favourite_animal <- "dog"
Favourite_dish<- "Ngege"

# 3. Delete all of the script below

a <- 3+1
b <- 5+5
c <- 10*10

# 4. Write whatever you want below as a comment (start the line with a #)
#It is really interesting to see how this works###
